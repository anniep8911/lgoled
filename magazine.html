                                    <h3>How Technology Completes Digital Art & Our Lives</h3>
                                    <p>In December 2021, the NFT platform Nifty Gateway held an online art auction where the digital work Merge was sold for $91.8m, setting a record as the costliest auction price for the work of an artist alive today. The piece itself, which depicts a solitary pale-colored sphere set against a darkened background, is nearly impossible to interpret according to existing conventions of present-day art. Moreover, Merge also stood in stark contrast to previous works of art in how it was auctioned and how its ownership was attributed.</p>

                                    <p>The long-awaited ringing of musical joy filled London's Royal Albert Hall as a rendition of William Walton's “Belshazzar's Feast” — performed by Sir Bryn Terfel, one of the greatest bass-baritones of our time, the Philharmonia Chorus of more than 100 singers, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) — reached its climax. The exhilarating occasion, which brought together the RPO with Terfel and cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, was held on September 21st, 2021 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the world-renowned ensemble.</p>
